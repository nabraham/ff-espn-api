## Raiders Redux Scripts
Scripts in this directory are used to generate preseason keeper options and end-of-season payouts.  To use them, create the file `$HOME/.config/ff-espn-api/config.json`.  It should contain the following:
```javascript
{
    "league_id": "<your espn league id number>",
    "s2": "<your s2 token>",
    "swid": "<your swid token>" 
}
```
See the README in the root project folder for more information about each attribute.
